Homes here range from turn-of-the-century bungalows and Craftsman-era properties to mid-century ranches in the hills, and many of them have been in the same families for decades. That history gives Orange its character, but it also means sellers often face properties that need significant work before they would satisfy a traditional buyer\'s lender. For homeowners who want to sell without the expense and delay of renovation, a direct cash sale is a reliable alternative.\n\nAt Father & Son Home Buyers, we purchase homes directly from homeowners across the City of Orange and all of Orange County. We are exactly what our name suggests: a father-son team whose decades of construction and real estate experience inform every evaluation and every offer. We buy in as-is condition, and sellers are never charged commissions, agent fees, or out-of-pocket costs of any kind. Historic and older properties require a buyer who understands what renovation actually involves, and our construction background means we assess condition accurately rather than guessing. Our step-by-step buying process lays out exactly how we work.',

Older homes commonly come with dated electrical and plumbing, or additions that were never permitted.\n\nWe buy single-family homes, condos, and small rentals across Rialto as-is — occupied or vacant — and can close on a schedule that works around tenants and move-out dates.',
